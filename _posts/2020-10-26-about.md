I'm Radu Stoenescu.

I work in Computer Science(CS) doing research and entrepreneurship. The CS fields I'm most excited about happen to be those I'm most knowledgeable about: computer networks, programming languages, reliability and verification.

Besides work, I like biking, espresso, and spending time with the close ones(preferably outside, in nature).

This is the place where I post stuff when I couldn't find any other place on the Internet(Facebook, Instagram etc.) to post instead.

I'm a Romanian living in Romania, thus certain posts might be written in Romanian. When this is a problem feel free to use Google's translate for help.
